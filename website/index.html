    <h1>gg-tools</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>gg-tools is a set of CLI (command line interface) tools 
      to control <a href="http://gogrid.com">GoGrid</a> cloud.
      It also provides a <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>
      module with the interface to the GoGrid 
      <a href="http://wiki.gogrid.com/wiki/index.php/API">API</a>. It has
      no additional dependencies but Python itself and should work with
      both CPython and Jython.
     </p>

     <h2>News</h2>
     <p>Version <b>0.2.0</b> released! Changes:</p>
  
     <ul>
       <li>Support API v 1.2, including MyGSI</li>
       <li>Use XML instead of CSV which seems to be more reliable and error-prone</li>
       <li>Support multiple config profiles</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Download</h2>
     <p>Latest release: <a href="dist/gg-%%VERSION%%.tar.gz">%%VERSION%%</a></p>

     <h2>Installation</h2>
     <p>After you've downloaded and upacked gg-tools, just go into its
       directory and execute:</p>

     <code>sudo python setup.py install</code>

     <p>It will install both CLI tools and Python module onto your system.</p>

     <h2>Configuration</h2>
     <p>All you need to do is to obtain your 
     <a href="http://wiki.gogrid.com/wiki/index.php/API:Anatomy_of_a_GoGrid_API_Call#API_Key">API key</a> 
     and password and put them in a file <tt>~/.ggrc</tt> in a format:</p>

     <pre>
     [default]
     apikey: your_api_key
     secret: your_secret
     </pre>

     <h2>Usage</h2>

     <h3>Server Images</h3>
     <p>In order to get a list of available images use <tt>gg-images-list</tt> tool.
       It doesn't require you to specify any arguments and is just as simple as that:
     </p>

     <pre>		
	     image rhel51_64_lamp (id = 21)
	     image rhel51_64_mysql (id = 22)
	     image rhel51_64_postgresql (id = 23)
	     image centos51_64_apache (id = 24)
	     image centos51_64_php (id = 25)
	     image centos51_64_lamp (id = 26)
     </pre>

     <p>By example of the first line: here <tt>rhel51_64_lamp</tt> is 
     a name of the image and <tt>21</tt> is its numeric id. In all gg tools 
     if you need specify some image, you can use both id or name, so remember id or a  name
     of the image you're interested it.</p>

     <h3>Creating Servers</h3>
     <p>To create a server you can use <tt>gg-server-add</tt> tool. It accepts the following arguments:
     <p>

     <ul>
      <li><b>-n</b> - name of the server, for example: <i>my_new_server</i>. It's a required option and
      you cannot omit it.</li>
      <li><b>-i</b> - image to use for the server, As you probably remember, you can use image name (for
      example: <i>centos51_64_apache</i>) or image id (for example: <i>24</i>). This is options cannot be
      omitted as well.</li>
      <li><b>-r</b> - an amount of RAM for the server. Possible values are: <i>512MB</i>, <i>1GB</i>,
       <i>2GB</i>, <i>4GB</i> and <i>8GB</i>. You, however, cannot use 8GB with some images, for example,
       32-bit images generally cannot have more than 2Gb of RAM.</li>
      <li><b>-a</b> - this is an <i>optional</i> arg allows you to specify an address for a server. If you
      omit it, <tt>gg-server-add</tt> tool will pick a random unassigned public ip. If you need
      to specify address yourself, read further to know how to get a list of available IP addresses.</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>Finding Out Credentials For Logging On To Servers</h3>
     <p>As you've created your server, you'd most certainly like to log into it. :-) You can use
     <tt>gg-password</tt> tool to list passwords for your servers. Typical output would look this way:
     </p>

     <pre>
id             username             password               server
31830                 root             foobar1         192.168.0.1
31831                 root             barfoor1	 	192.168.0.2
     </pre>

     <ul>
       <li><b>id</b> is an internal id of a password object. Most likely you will not need it,
       but anyways it can be useful if you'd like to open GoGrid case for example if you'd have
       some problems with logging in.</li>
       <li><b>username</b> - that's quite obvious, username you should log as, usually <tt>root</tt>
       <li><b>passowrd</b> - should be obvious as well
       <li><b>server</b> - ip address of the server in subject
      </ul>

     <p>A typical use would be like: <tt>gg-password | grep 192.168.0.1</tt> so the <tt>grep</tt> tool
     leaves only server you're currently interested in.</p>

     <h3>Dealing With IP Addresses</h3>
     <p><tt>gg-ip</tt> allows to obtain various information about IPs belonging to your account. Without
     specifying any arguments, <tt>gg-ip</tt> just print out all the IPs available. However, it supports
     various arguments which allow to perform some queries:</p>

     <ul>
       <li><b>-t</b> - type of the IP, can be either <i>pu</i> (for public) or <i>pr</i> (for private)</li>
       <li><b>-s</b> - state of the IP, can be either <i>u</i> (for unassigned) or <i>a</i> (for assigned)</li>
       <li><b>-v</b> - this key doesn't actually control search results, just makes output more verbose.</i>
     </ul>

     <p>For example, if you want to list of all free (unassigned) public IPs, you should do:</p>

     <pre>gg-ip -t pu -s u</pre>

     <h3>Removing servers</h3>
     <p>You can remove servers using <tt>gg-server-delete</tt> tool. You can remove it by id:
     </p>

     <pre>gg-server-delete -i 12345</pre>

     <p>Or you can remove it by name:</p>

     <pre>gg-server-delete -n myserv</pre>

     <p>And you can even remove a set of servers that match a regular expression:</p>

     <pre>gg-server-delete -rn 'foobar_*'</pre>

     <p>In regex mode, <tt>gg-server-delete</tt> asks confirmation before deleting servers to
     make sure you didn't make unexpected errors in regular expressions and don't removing
     something that doesn't need to be removed. However, you can pass <tt>-q</tt> key if it
     annoys you.</p>

     <h3>MyGSI</h3>
     <p>MyGSI allows to create custom server images. You can get more details on it 
     <a href="http://wiki.gogrid.com/wiki/index.php/MyGSI">here</a>. The process of creating
     custom image with gg tools looks this way:<p>

     <p>You need to create a new server which would serve as a basis for new image. You should
     use <tt>gg-server-add</tt> and pass all the arguments you usually pass to it and in addition
     pass <tt>-s</tt> argument which would make it a sandbox. Now, when you execute <tt>gg-server-list</tt>,
     each sandbox will be marked with <tt>&gt;</tt> sign.</p>

     <p>Once the server has provisioned, you can perform all the customizations you need. When done, execute
     <tt>/root/prep.py</tt> on the server and then on your own box execute:</p>

     <pre>gg-image-save -n my_new_image -s 12345 -d 'some cool image'</pre>

     <p>Where <tt>my_new_image</tt> is the name of your brand new image, <tt>12345</tt> is the id of the server
     you're using as a basis and <tt>-d</tt> is an optional switch for description of the image.</p>

     <p>Now the new image should be available in <tt>gg-image-list</tt> and you can use it like any other
     usual image.</p>

     <h3>Multiple Config Profiles</h3>
     <p>As of version <tt>0.2.0</tt> gg tools support having multiple config profiles. Section 'Configuration'
     describes how to create 'default' section. You can follow this pattern and add additional sections, like
     e.g. <tt>myacc2</tt> and when you will need to switch to <tt>myacc2</tt> you will pass <tt>-p myacc2</tt>
     args to the gg tool you need to use. It should not be hard to guess that section 'default' is
     used by default.</p>
