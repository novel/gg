Easy to use tools to manage your GoGrid servers. Work both
with Python and Jython, don't need any non-standard modules.

To start it you have to create a config file ~/.ggrc with the 
following content:

----------
[default]
apikey: yourapikey
secret: yoursecret
---------

Almost every script has a meaningful (I hope) name and a 
brief description how to use it in its header.

gg comes with the setup.py, so if you want to globally install it,
the following command should be executed:

	sudo python setup.py install

Notes:

- It's ok to ignore warnings about deprecated md5 module if you
  are using python 2.6 or newer. md5 kept for the sake of making
  scripts workable with jython
